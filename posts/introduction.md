* Reasoning

## Background

We started out as two technical writers who hung out on
[tilde.town](https://tilde.town). We didn't know of each other's presence on
tilde.town at first, but then when we found out we were both technical writers,
and from Canada, we started to exchange ideas related to a project that could
teach people about public Unix servers, the decentralized web, and the command
line, regardless of their technical background. What you are currently reading
is the start of that project.

## Reasoning

By creating this project, we can combine our passion for technical writing,
public Unix servers, the decentralized web, and the command line.

## Goals

We want to introduce people to topics that aren't widely understood, and provide
people with enough technical knowledge to understand and use public Unix
servers, the decentralized web, and the command line.  platforms, such as public
Unix servers.
